# Virtual Human – AI Health Companion

## 🧠 Introduction

**Virtual Human** is an AI project aimed at developing an accessible virtual assistant to support individuals with low health literacy. The assistant will guide users in understanding and managing their well-being by simplifying access to trusted health resources, such as those on the Dutch platform **"De Stap."**

By engaging users in clear, step-by-step conversations, the AI filters and delivers personalized health content—helping users build healthier, more active lifestyles, without overwhelming them with information.

## 🎯 Purpose & Goals

### The Problem  
Despite the abundance of health content, many low-literate individuals in the Netherlands struggle to:
- Understand complex text-based resources.
- Know where to start.
- Stay engaged on platforms like "De Stap."

### The Vision  
Create a **conversational AI assistant** that:
- Engages users in a simple, intuitive flow.
- Asks clear questions to understand needs.
- Recommends relevant health resources.
- Builds trust through personalized and visual communication.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-powered assistant** for guiding users.
- 🗣️ **Simple, accessible dialogue** with the user.
- 🧩 **Personalized content** recommendation.
- 🌍 **Multilingual support** for better reach (optional future step).
- 📈 **Engagement tracking** to evaluate performance.

## 🧪 Technical Overview

- **AI Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Model Type**: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Recommendation System
- **Interface**: Chatbot (web-based or voice-assisted)
- **Training Dataset**:
  - Curated health texts from De Stap
  - Synthetic dialogues simulating user queries
  - Annotated low-literacy question/response pairs
- **Deployment**: Standalone or integrated into the existing De Stap website

## 🚀 Start project

- **Environment**: Make a .env file in the front-end folder
- **Add api keys**: Add the API keys in the .env folder as seen here:
  - OPENAI_API_KEY=INSERT_YOUR_OWN_KEY_HERE
  - ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=INSERT_YOUR_OWN_KEY_HERE
- **CD**: Type the command CD front-end
- **Install packages**: Type npm install
- **Start application**: Use command npm run dev
- **Open application**: Go to the localhost or IP-adress in the command line. The application should work then
- **Chatbot data embedding**: After sending the first message it takes a while for the chatbot to react. This is because of the AI generating and embedding the data. He only needs to do this once.

## 🧭 Implementation Plan

1. **Data Collection**
   - Source structured health content
   - Analyze engagement patterns from "De Stap"
2. **Model Training**
   - Build and fine-tune conversational AI
   - Train for classification and recommendation
3. **Prototype & Test**
   - MVP with basic health query navigation
   - User testing and feedback loops
4. **Iteration**
   - Weekly updates (Friday check-ins)
   - Refine based on engagement and usability metrics
